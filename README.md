- WASD keys for player 1 and ARROW keys for player 2.
- Two rounds: round 1 using player 1 theme, round 2 using player 2 theme. Tie is allowed.
- Each player has to jump on other player's head to cause damage. The attacked player changes to mini size and keeps invincible for some seconds.
- If a player gets hit a second time, it looses the round.

<!-- NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS -->
## :keyboard: Notes for developers

#### :computer: Game engine

The game is made with Construct3, a web no-code/low-code game engine. The folder is a project structure, and must be built using Construct Editor.

#### :sound: Music and FX

Using sound fx and soundtrack from both classic games, edited with Audacity. The sound is started after first user interacts with the window.

#### :space_invader: Sprites

All sprites downloaded and edited with MS Paint.

<!-- FINAL CONSIDERATIONS -->
## Final considerations

No-code game engines are great to start children into programming. This project was used to teach a 11 years old child some game logic and design techniques.
